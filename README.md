*scRNA-seq Analyses:*

scRNA1-QC: Quality control and standard pre-processing of scRNA data using Seurat v4.0. 

scRNA2-UMAP: Louvain clustering + UMAP visualization of scRNA data following transformation. 

scRNA3-DE: Assignment of cluster identities based DE genes (using MAST - Finak et al., 2015). 

scRNA4-Monocle3: Pseudotime analysis using Monocle3. Analyses include model fitting to identity gene expression changes as a function of pseudotime.
